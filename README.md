üöÄ Frenck's GitHub Action for setting up yq.

## About

A very simple and easy to use GitHub Action for setting up [yq][yq] for use in
your GitHub Actions.

All it does is installing it, so you can use it for reading or manipulating
YAML files in your GitHub actions.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Example
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  example:
    name: Example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: üèó Set up yq
        uses: frenck/action-setup-yq@v1
      - name: üöÄ Use yq
        run: yq --version
```

## Versions & Updating

You can specify which version of this GitHub Action your workflow should use.
And even allowing for using the latest major or minor version.

For example; this will use release `v1.1.1` of a GitHub Action:

```yaml
- name: üèó Set up yq
  uses: frenck/action-setup-yq@v1.1.1
```

While the following example, will use the `v1.1.x` minor release, for example
if `v1.1.2` is the latest releases (starting with `v1.1`), this will run
`v1.1.2`:

```yaml
- name: üèó Set up yq
  uses: frenck/action-setup-yq@v1.1
```

As in the examples throughout the documentation, the following example is
locked on major version, meaning any `v1.x.x` latest version will be used,
as long as it is version 1.

```yaml
- name: üèó Set up yq
  uses: frenck/action-setup-yq@v1
```

### Automatically update using Dependabot

The advantage of locking against a more specific version, is that it prevents
surprises if an issue or breaking changes were introduced in a newer release.

The disadvantage of being more specific, is that it requires you to keep things
up to date. Fortunately, GitHub has a tool for that, called: Dependabot.

Dependabot can automatically open a pull request on your repository to update
this Action for you. You can instantly see if the new version works (as the
pull request shows the success or failure status) and you can decide to
merge it in by hitting the merge button. Quick, easy and always up2date.

To enable Dependabot, create a file called `.github/dependabot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: daily
```

Your all set! Dependabot will now check (and update) your GitHub actions
every day. ü§©
